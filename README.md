# The repository structure of our project consists of two main directories: "backend" and "frontend".

## Backend:
- The "backend" directory contains all the server-side code and resources for our collaboration tool. This includes the implementation of APIs, database management, user authentication, and other server-side functionalities. The backend code will handle the business logic and data processing for the tool, and it will communicate with the frontend components through defined APIs.

## Frontend:
- The "frontend" directory contains all the client-side code and resources for our collaboration tool. This includes the user interface, user interactions, and user experience components. The frontend code will be responsible for rendering the interface, capturing user input, and communicating with the backend APIs to fetch and update data from the server. It will provide the visual and interactive components of our tool that users will interact with.
